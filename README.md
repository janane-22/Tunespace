## TuneSpace â€” Music Studio Booking System
TuneSpace is a web-based music studio booking system designed to make studio scheduling simple, efficient, and accessible for all kinds of musicians. The platform helps artists, bands, instrumentalists, and podcasters easily book available studio rooms based on time slots, class types, and budgets.

## Project Overview
The system replicates real-world studio booking operations. Users can register, log in, select studio classes (1st, 2nd, or 3rd), and instantly confirm their bookings.
